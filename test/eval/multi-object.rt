# Place several intersecting objects on the scene, such as for example a sphere
# and a cylinder, and display the rendered image. Both objects should be
# visible and displayed without glitching. (especially where both object intersect)

# Execute the same test, but ensure it's possible to place the same object
# several times, for example two cylinders, two spheres and a plane.
