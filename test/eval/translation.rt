# Place two spheres at the coordinates {0, 0, 0},
# the camera facing those spheres. Then put a translation
# on one of the two spheres oriented in a direction parallel
# to the camera's, of a greater distance than the sphere's
# diameter and display the rendered image. Both spheres should
# be visible and displayed without glitching.
